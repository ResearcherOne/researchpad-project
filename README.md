..* Try http://api.semanticscholar.org/ for cited by & reference fetch.
..* Initially I may just start first node using arxiv no, doi, etc. Then navigate in the literature using clicking. No more inputting link or something needed afterwards.
..* It is work to check this reference and title extractor project. https://github.com/Crossref/pdfextract
Wait seems like these people have a newer maintained version: https://github.com/ResearcherOne/CERMINE anyways it is worth to see the web page of pdf extract https://www.crossref.org/labs/pdfextract/
